# Milestone 1

I struggled to choose what I wanted to make for this class's Project 1 assignment. Due to the web's abundance of information, resources, and sources of inspiration, it may be an overwhelming environment. However, this is what I like most about the Internet. I picked this course because I want to develop the ability (in which I am still dipping my toes) to produce great, intriguing, and engaging work so that my websites might one day serve as an inspiration and a resource for other novice web designers to learn from and grow from. 
I spend hours and hours on behance, dribble, instagram, youtube, and even tik tok browsing over amazing website designs, and by cool I mean EXTREMELY COOL website designs, despite the fact that I am still not proficient at it. 
I am still determining where I want to take my career, but based on my exploration and observation of what I am drawn to, I have a strong suspicion that I am interested in User Interface design and have a strong preference for minimalist designs and aesthetics. Not just minimalisms, but subtle or exaggerated animations on a website, app, or design of any kind also pique my interest. I've always had a passion for animation, and I want to include it into my works. When websites employ large, eye-catching pictures to make a statement, it also keeps me interested. The reason for this is my passion for photography. Having an eye for subtleties in photography and understanding how a snapshot or video may communicate a narrative without the need for accompanying language is, in my view, one of the most beautiful things to comprehend and experience. 

Due to the fact that the Project 1 brief allowed for the selection of any topic, I intend to design a landing page that incorporates the majority, if not all, of the aforementioned elements.


My inspiration comes from www.apple.com, one of my favorite websites. The way Apple has created their webpages is precisely what I want to do in the future. The flow of graphics driven by the scroll intrigues me and I believe it's an incredible technique to maintain user interest. I have always admired the notion of a gradual unveiling of information. Also, the manner in which the text is animated and movies are played in the background with an overlay of text is very intriguing to see while simultaneously learning and reading through the text to comprehend the product they are attempting to advertise to such a broad audience. 



### PROJECT IDEA:
For my project, I'd want to create a landing page for a skincare brand that has a minimalist look, with just the logo and a hamburger menu in the navigation bar. 
And for the homepage design, I want one of their serum bottles to open and show the brand name as you scroll down. Depending on how complex the code becomes, I may adjust it such that the name appears first and the serum container shuts as the user scrolls down. 
I am aware that I am biting off more than I can chew, but I want to use this as a challenge to learn new methods and develop a creative style. 

Javascript is such a strong and extensive programming language, and I want to use it to create animations using code. In Justin Gitlin's class from last year, I learnt a little bit about what javascript may be able to achieve with p5.js, and I'd want to see how I can combine some of my knowledge from that course as well.




### PROTOTYPE AND DESIGN: 
Before sketching the prototype, I made a list of what I intended to accomplish. This note only stated, MINIMALISM, PRODUCT, ENGAGING. 
Then I chose The Ordinary as my brand. The primary reason I chose to work with a product was because products provide enough opportunity to demonstrate creativity and diversity in design. My second source of inspiration was www.seed.com, a website I found onto while surfing the Internet. Additionally, they do a decent job with the scrolling animation. There is a portion of their product where a capsule shuts on scrolling. That is what I want to achieve. 
I discovered via some investigation that the scroll animation is based on the notion of frame-by-frame animation. Consider a stop-motion animation, in which many frames are stitched together to generate a motion picture or a still image that, when assembled, resembles a video. Thus, each frame would be mapped to each time the scroll is enabled in this instance. As you scroll down, a new frame is added, creating a moving image on the screen. 
Another motivation for doing this was because I own the product and wanted to practice my photography abilities by taking the frame-by-frame photographs of the bottle myself for use on the website, as I couldn't locate what I needed. 

The scrolling motion is an excellent approach to convey information on both desktop and mobile screens. Therefore, it would be simple to make this website responsive. 
Having worked on my class portal website, I have understood that I must first design for a mobile (smaller) screen and then scale it up to meet a desktop resolution. 

Listed below is a prototype of how I want to create the website. I drew it out frame by frame and animated it, which gave me an idea of how I would attempt to do this using javascript. 


I want to focus only on the landing page and first brand introduction at this time. In the future, if I am able to do this successfully, I would want to build on this and maybe improve on the design and aesthetic I established, as well as overhaul the present website (www.theordinary.com). Or build an individual product page. 

In conclusion, my aims for this project are to learn and educate myself how to create extremely fascinating and captivating animations using javascript, and I feel that this is an excellent opportunity to exercise my imagination and push myself to produce something I've never made before.

# Milestone 2

In my second milestone, I began by designing a landing page and a prototype that mimicked the appearance of the real website. 
The design of my website is centered on how the page animates using the scroll bar. 
I generated a sequence of photos by first capturing stop-motion photographs of the product on a backdrop. 
I then imported them into Adobe Xd and placed each picture on a separate screen. Every time the user scrolls through, a new screen or the next picture in the sequence of photos will appear. After adding all the photos, I proceeded to add the text. 
As one scrolls down, the text would essentially reveal itself word by letter beside each picture. 


### Changes to initial design
While taking the photographs, I noticed that it was more efficient to take the shots by rolling the bottle instead of opening the bottle, as I illustrated in my earlier prototype for milestone 1. 
Initially, I intended to only create the animation where the landing page reveals the brand name and product without going into product detail. However, as I was creating the prototype, I decided to add an additional section where, once the brand name and product are revealed, the product rolls across the screen from right to left, hiding the brand name, and a product page will appear where the user can add the product to their cart and also the number of products they can purchase. 

Next, it will be essential to figure out how to deal with text animation on scroll and its opacity. For the final website, I will reshoot the photographs in better lighting, but for the time being, I will use the images that I have already taken to add them to the website and implement them in the code. 

### Future changes 
In addition to these modifications, when I reach the product page, I may add extra descriptions, buttons, and hover animations to other items or add a drop down menu option to increase the user experience of the website.

# PROJECT 1- MILESTONE 4 


Based on my original prototype design, I believe I've completed 80% of what I set out to do. 
The objective of my first job was to design a landing page for The Ordinary, an ecommerce website. It was my interpretation of how I intended the landing page's scrolling motion to display the brand name and product. 

The Apple website, which has a similar idea in which items unveil themselves with text animation to create an interesting user experience, served as inspiration for this project. 

This notion was absolutely foreign to me, and I had never done anything like before. To understand how to produce the animation, I viewed a lot of YouTube tutorials and researched a variety of methods. I then followed several instructions and modified my code accordingly. 


I originally accepted the task of making a stop-motion animation film of the bottle to kick off my complete design. I used a corkboard as my background and several boxes as my tripod to create a little photographic studio. This was also the first time I have filmed a stop motion video which was pretty awesome. I then integrated the mp4 file containing the video into the code. 

I then addressed the code. I discovered a new tool, the cdnjs libraries, for incorporating scroll motion into the code. Allowing me to additionally deal with text animation. I also learnt how you could shuffle between multiple pictures and how to apply minor animations to these images. The CSS portion of the code was straightforward. I learnt a lot more about javascript and how various syntaxes work. I first determined how to synchronize my video with the scroll bar and how the scroll bar matches to the length of the video. This was a fascinating discovery that allowed me to animate my text such that its opacity varies on scroll to expose itself with the video. The most difficult aspect was figuring out how to link the mp4 video to the scroll bar. Another problem was that my video won't render correctly when I launched it and it would frustrate me because I didn't know whether the video was functioning along with the scroll or not which later Preetam and others advised me to comment out some data that is being logged into the console, which is causing the transition to be sluggish; thus, I discovered the problem and commented it out, which has made my video more smooth. 

I was pleased with my landing page/splash screen design and quite proud to have created it just as I had imagined. However, I want the challenge of adding an extra page, so I created a Product description page. 

I wanted to develop a button that reads "Explore Product" after the landing page animation is complete and the scroll bar reaches the bottom of the page. Clicking this button would send you to a new page where you may see the product. 

I incorporated several of the methods I learned in class, like as the various input kinds and how to navigate between photos, to the product page. 


This project pushed me to work with code I had never done before, which is my primary takeaway from it. Going through many blogs and youtube videos enabled me to develop a better grasp of javascript and how to leverage open source libraries to construct a website rather than constantly having to write from scratch. 

This project also helped me grasp my own aesthetics as a front end developer, and I anticipate working on ecommerce websites and similar projects in the future. 

My greatest concern was that I would give up and be unable to complete anything because I couldn't get my code to work. However, as I was persistent and kept going back and forth with it, I was able to see my errors in different ways, which allowed me to overcome these obstacles using various methods and trial and error (hence you see a lot of code that is commented out in my code). 

On my project, I received positive comments from both my professor and my classmates, which served as an excellent incentive to keep progressing. 
It was also extremely exciting to see what others had made and to be inspired by their work, which is a fantastic way to learn new things and gain fresh knowledge. 
Overall, I believe I had obstacles, but I gave my best to create something I am proud of. 

## NEW ADDITIONS TO THE DESIGN 
Today, I figured it out, made it work, and gained so much new knowledge! 

First, I worked on the product page since I deemed it uninteresting and wanted to improve it. I did not take a screenshot of the screen earlier, but the initial layout consisted of four photographs, text on the side, buttons, and no embellishments. 
The smaller photos would shuffle when clicked, but I wanted the background to also shift to correlate with the image selected. Hence learnt how to do that by creating a new function and calling both the functions on click in html which would perform the two functions at the same time. After I got it to working and had the background and other photos change on click, I used the same method to create a third function where the text would also change based on which product image was selected. 

Next, I returned to my landing page and determined how to make the "Explore Product" button appear from the bottom when the scroll reaches its conclusion. 
Then, I found out that it was not immediately apparent that scrolling was required when the website was first accessed. Consequently, I learnt how to animate a button including arrows to indicate to the user that they must scroll rather than click or wait for anything to happen. This was a lot of fun to design since it was the first time I used tags animation and keyframes. 


Finally, I modified the navigation bar and added additional links since it seemed quite bare. 

In conclusion, I acquired some new approaches while completing my project to make the website more interactive and visually appealing. I learnt how to embed many functions and call them simultaneously with a single button press. I learnt how to animate a button as well. When I attempted to alter the text using innerHTML, the whole layout of the product page was screwed up, and the background does not change simultaneously with the image. I persisted in working through my issues, reviewing and changing my code, and commenting things out until I eventually got everything to function flawlessly!
